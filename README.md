Kubnerable is an out-cluster vulnerability scanner tool for Kubernetes resources. It comes with a predefined vulnerability 
database (`vulnerabilities.yaml`) with basic pod weaknesses checks.

For testing purposes, there is a Kind setup for bootstrapping a cluster with vulnerable predefined scenarios. For more info,
check the following [README](kubnerable_cluster/README.md).
